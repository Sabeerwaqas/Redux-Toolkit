/*
    Redux store and redux are kind of use interchangeably
    both stand for container for JavaScript apps. It stores
    the whole state of the app an immutable object tree and really
    the intended pattern for redux is just to have a single store
    for your application multiple stores are possible but that is
    not what is recommended by the creators of reduxt.
